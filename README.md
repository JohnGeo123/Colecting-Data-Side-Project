Idea for Project: Interactive Survey

Overview: Provide an interactive survey form that allows users to answer a series of questions. Both the form's appearance and usability should be high priority. The replies will be gathered and kept for a future study.

Qualities:

Questionnaire Interface: Create a list of inquiries addressing a range of subjects. Users should be able to choose from alternatives (such as multiple-choice, checkboxes, and text input) for each inquiry.

Validation: Use client-side validation (such as mandatory fields and text input formats) to make sure users answer questions appropriately.

Dynamic user interface: Add dynamic features to the form using jQuery, such as the ability to show or hide parts based on user input or to dynamically update options based on selections made in the past.

Data collection: Either locally (using browser storage such as localStorage) or remotely (via a server-side script) store user replies. Make sure the information gathered is arranged and structured to facilitate analysis and retrieval.

Visual Design: The survey form can be styled using CSS to make it visually appealing and easy for people to browse.

Provide a progress indicator to help users know how far along they are in finishing the survey.

Ensure that the survey form has a responsive design so that it functions properly on a range of screens and devices.
